# MLOps Coursework from DeepLearning.AI

My complete implementation of assignments in _Machine Learning Engineering for Production (MLOps) Specialization_ taught by Andrew Ng on Coursera. This repo is a collection of my implemented scripts and projects for future reference (course found in this [repo](https://github.com/https-deeplearning-ai/machine-learning-engineering-for-production-public/tree/main)).
